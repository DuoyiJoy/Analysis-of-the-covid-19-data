abstract: "I plot the variables:gender and age groups independently first.Then I try to relate them with the outcome ,and visulizie the relationship between them respectively.Despite the missing data and limitation of resources, I draw a conclusion that there exist a solid connection between age and the recovery rate.But there seem to be no difference beween the gender in front of the covid-19."
